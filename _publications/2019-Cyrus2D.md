The following team description paper demonstrates the activities carried out in the most recent year by Cyrus 2D simulation team, in brief. During this year, some tasks have been conducted in order to improve the team's offensive and defensive behavior, using machine learning. Some of the mentioned tasks will be looked into in this paper, with our main focus being on the implementation of deep reinforcement learning in Cyrus's defensive agents' decision making.
