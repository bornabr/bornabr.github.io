I’m Borna, a machine learning researcher and engineer with over four years of experience in both industry and academia. Currently, I work as an algorithm designer at [Cognitive Systems Corp.](https://www.cognitivesystems.com/). I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from York University.

## Research Interests
My research focuses on developing representation learning frameworks that generalize across tasks without relying on supervised signals. I am particularly interested in unsupervised and self-supervised learning to tackle challenges related to low-labeled data and out-of-distribution detection.

Lately, my work has centered on contrastive learning and predictive coding frameworks for time-series data applications. During my master’s research, I developed a self-supervised learning framework for Channel State Information (CSI) from WiFi signals, with applications in indoor human activity recognition (HAR) and other WiFi sensing technologies.
