I’m Borna, a machine learning researcher and engineer with over four years of experience in both industry and academia. Currently, I work as an algorithm designer at [Cognitive Systems Corp.](https://www.cognitivesystems.com/) where I design and develop representation learning solutions for motion sequential data in WiFi sensing applications. I recently graduated in 2024 with a Master’s degree in Computer Science from York University, where I worked with Dr. [Hina Tabassum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hina-tabassum-85953567/) in the [NGWN](https://sites.google.com/view/ngwn-research-lab/home) research lab. There, I led research on WiFi sensing, focusing on self-supervised learning and lightweight compression networks.

## Research Interests
My research centers on building representation learning frameworks that generalize across tasks without relying on supervised signals. I have a strong interest in unsupervised and self-supervised learning to address challenges such as low-labeled data and out-of-distribution detection.

Recently, my work has focused on contrastive learning and predictive coding frameworks for time-series data. As part of my master's research, I developed a self-supervised learning framework for Channel State Information (CSI) time-series data from WiFi signals, with in indoor human activity recognition (HAR) and other WiFi sensing applications.
